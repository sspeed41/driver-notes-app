## 🚨 If Your App Breaks

### Quick Fix (30 seconds)
```bash
./recover-app.sh
```

### Manual Fix
1. Copy the working environment file:
   ```bash
   cp backups/2025-05-26/env.local.working .env.local
   ```
2. Restart your server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Unterminated string in JSON"
- **Cause**: `.env.local` file has line breaks in JSON
- **Fix**: Use the recovery script or copy the working backup

### "Google Sheets credentials not configured"
- **Cause**: Missing or malformed `.env.local` file
- **Fix**: Restore from backup

### "Module not found" errors
- **Cause**: Missing dependencies
- **Fix**: Run `npm install`

## 📋 Maintenance

### Creating New Backups
```bash
# Create new dated backup
mkdir -p backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
cp .env.local backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/env.local.working
```

### Testing Your Setup
```bash
# Test API endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/sheets

# Check file format
wc -l .env.local  # Should output: 2 .env.local
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

- ✅ `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` (never committed)
- ✅ `backups/` directory is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Credentials are stored locally only
- ⚠️ Keep backups secure and private
